\section{Functional requirements}


FR1 - Expert Interface\\
A crisis management expert should be able to set up a game template for teams to use. This interface should be able to configure as many variables in the game as possible(game rules), and be able to create maps, change the number of players, where they start, what events can occur and when, and create information cards.\\
\\
FR2 - Game Manager\\
An expert should be able to enter an existing game as a Game Manager. The GM should be able to trigger events and modify the game objects on the fly to make the game more dynamic, as well as comment on player actions. The GM should be able to monitor activity on the server, existing sessions and online players.\\
\\
FR3 - Player Profiles\\
Each player should have a profile that records the players performance in played games. This includes tracking wins and losses, listing game replays and other metrics that are relevant.\\
\\
FR4 - Replay\\
An expert should be able to view finished games as a re-play, to evaluate player performance. These replays should be stored in the database, to be viewed at any time.\\
\\
FR5 - Game functionality\\
In addition to adapting the functionality of the board game version to an electronic platform, as specified in appendix ~\ref{appendix:B}, the number of people in a zone should affect how panic spreads between zones, and inside them. \\
\\
FR6 - Physical interaction\\
Preferably, the game should be able to respond to commands sent by interaction devices such as Arduino or Sifteo cubes. They could be used to represent zones, players or be used as controllers for movement.\\
\\


\subsection{Use cases}
The use cases are mainly based on the functional requirements of the game and are a graphical representation of the users’ interactions with the board game. They document all the different ways in which the user can interact with the game. 
\\
A detailed set of use case diagrams and textual use cases are provided below.\\

\section{Non functional requirements} 


All non functional requirements comply with the definitions as stated in the ISO 25010 standard (replacing ISO 9126). Only relevant requirements are mentioned in this report.

\subsection{Quality in use}

\emph{1: Efficiency}\\
Like regular board games, actions should not be difficult to execute. The players are working against the clock (the panic increase timer). Hence, when designing the user interface, one of the goals should be to minimize the number of clicks required.
\\\newline
\emph{2: Context Coverage}\\
The system should be flexible enough to accommodate individual experts’ preferences and needs in their simulations. By relying on the settings given by the expert through the expert interface form, the best possible flexibility can be ensured.

\subsection{Product quality}

\emph{1: Functional suitability}\\
Functional completeness should be achieved to include the core functionality 
of the board game, as well as the functionality specific to the electronic 
version, like the expert interface and panic- and people management. 
\\
Core functions must be without game-breaking bugs to ensure functional 
correctness.
\\\newline
\emph{2: Operability}\\
Usability is considered important, as the users should spend time playing the 
game and learn how to manage panic, rather than how to operate the game. 
\\
By exploiting recognisability from classic board games, a lot of interaction 
can be made intuitive, given that most people already know how to play board 
games. 
\\
Users of the game will most likely not be as proficient with computers as 
“gamers” in general. Therefore, it would be a good idea to make the game 
accessible without having to install any software other than an internet browser.
\\\newline
\emph{3: Transferability}\\
The client should be usable on as many platforms as possible (Mac, Windows, 
Linux, Mobile platforms), and in the best possible case be able to interact 
with devices such as Arduino. HTML5 with node.js was chosen for this reason, as 
it can run on nearly any device without the need for time consuming 
installation procedures, thereby increasing portability.


\subsection{Technical requirements}
These requirements have been copied from the “Don’t Panic” specifications 
provided by the customer.\\

Don’t Panic DPS has to meet to the following requirements:\\
- All interaction between the server and client should be performed using well 
documented protocols and standard protocols.\\
- The DPS Game rules should be platform independent. Consequently, high level 
languages such as Java, Processing, Python could be considered as good 
candidates.\\
- The overall architecture should be scalable to run multiple Game sessions in 
parallel without decreasing the quality of already running games sessions.\\
-Already existing frameworks for game development for such as Unity, Microsoft 
XNA Game Studio, or management tools such as RedMine could be used as platforms 
to help speeding up the development of the game. The choice should be driven by 
a framework comparison analysis considering both technical requirements and 
already existing skills/experience among group participants.
