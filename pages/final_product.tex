\section{Completed features}
FR1 - Expert Interface
This feature is largely finished. It includes the ability to design a city map, set variables(rules) for the game, create event- and information cards used during a game and set the number of players and where they start.

FR5 - Game Functionality
This is first and foremost all the functionality of the original board game, as specified in the appendix, and is the most comprehensive requirement. All of these functions are completed, and works as intended.

\section{Suggestions for further development}

Extension of events as "quests":
Currently, events are simple triggers for a list of effects that take effect immediately, and cannot be stopped or specifically countered except by playing the game normally. By extending this feature to include "tasks" to be completed, like "quests" in RPGs, the game would be come more dynamic and varied. These task would include a list of actions the players have to complete in order to get a reward, or avoid a penalty. If a fire is not put out in a certain amount of rounds, for example, you could lose points or the zone could become permanently panicked.

Effect variation:
Further iteration on the "effect" function can increase the number of possible effects that can be made, both for events and information cards. The ability for effects to move players, destroy pathways, and manipulate road blocks could be added.

Sifteo cubes:
Sifteo cubes could be used as controllers or displays for a number of functions. They could be used to represent zones, if there are enough of them, or as players that can be moved through moving the cubes.
