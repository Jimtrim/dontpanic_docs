\section{Completed features}

This feature is largely finished. It includes the ability to design a city map, set variables(rules) for the game, and create event- and information cards used during the game.

FR5 - Game Functionality
This is first and foremost all the functionality of the original board game, as specified in the appendix, and is the most comprehensive requirement. All of these functions are completed, and works as intended.

\section{Suggestions for further development}

Extension of events as "quests"
Currently, events are simple triggers for a list of effects that take effect immediately, and cannot be stopped or specifically countered except by playing the game normally. By extending this feature to include "tasks" to be completed, like "quests" in RPGs, the game would be come more dynamic and varied. These task would include a list of actions the players have to complete in order to get a reward, or avoid a penalty. If a fire is not put out in a certain amount of rounds, for example, you could lose points or the zone could become permanently panicked.
