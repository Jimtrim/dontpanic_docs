Due to the extensive need for documentation, Scrum is not a suitable model of this process. Moreover, the intended model of process cannot be fitted in a waterfall model. Therefore, the model used will be a mixture of the best properties from both models. First of all the architecture will be designed along with the production of a detailed, sensible documentation. Then a simple, “bare bone” version of the game will be 
developed. Finally, the required features will be iterated on this version.
