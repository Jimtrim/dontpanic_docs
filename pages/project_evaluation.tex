\section{Lessons learned}

Early in the project there were daily meetings. Later on the need for daily meetings was regarded as unnecessary as the team was able to work individually with the appointed tasks. Therefore, the number of meetings was reduced to three days a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays). On Tuesdays and Thursdays the team members worked at home. Mondays were used as a sort of “kick-off”-day for the week and were used to plan specific tasks that were to be done during the week. This increased the efficiency.\\

During week 9 the group member responsible for sending status reports to the customer and supervisor was on vacation. Because of that, no status report was sent that week. The lesson learned from this is that communication within the team is crucial for the completion of all tasks in time.\\
