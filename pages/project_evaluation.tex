\chapter{Project evaluation}

\section{Team}

\subsection*{Task assignment}
When we first started our development we had no structure of dividing tasks among us. Since only a few of us had experience with Javascript, we were first of all trying to acquire some skill within this language. We were not working as a group should but only a vague understanding of what each other were doing. After some time working on our own and acquiring skills we had a discussions about the assignment of roles and tasks. We discussed the different big tasks within the project and appointed roles based on them. It was a questions of what each different member would preferably do. Assignment of task went well, no member felt he was put on a task he strongly disliked.

\subsection*{Roles assignment}

We appointed roles based on the big tasks within the project, expert interface, game, database and so fourth. As was stated before no member was deeply dissatisfied with their roles. Though the role of Sifteo manager which came much later in the project, was somewhat harder to assign, due to the already weighing work load. The appointment of team leader was done initially to one member at the time of the other role assignments, but later changed. 

\subsubsection{Evaluation of the different roles}
\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}
	\item Customer/supervisor contact \\
	The contact role has had very important tasks for the group, making sure status report has been sent to the supervisor,  had contact with the customer and scheduling meetings. Some of the tasks has been hard to follow such as sending status reports due to the fact that next weeks assignments was not always clear. 
	\item Server manager\\
Other than the usual coding difficulties the server was completed without much hassle. And the one responsible for the server has been the goto guy for questions relating this part of the game.
	\item LaTeX configuration manager\\
The role of LaTeX manager was introduced right after the midterm report was delivered. As mentioned earlier we used Google Docs to write the report, until it started acting up, due to the length of the document. We have had small difficulties working with LaTeX because only a few of us has previous experience with the program. The LaTeX manager is the one with the most LaTeX experience and has been our goto guy, from small to larger problems.

	\item Client manager\\
The client managers has had a larger workload containing coding, only one of these has had experience with Javascript before, and has been prompted with difficult questions most days.
	\item Expert interface manager\\
The expert interface manager has had a great workload containing coding, being the only one working on this separate part of the game. The expert interface manager has had small to no problems completing his tasks.
	\item Team manager\\
The team manager has not been strongly enforced, there has not been much need for an team manager to tell each member what to do at all times. The team manager has been important in the starting stages of the project, where some had to take actions concretely describing what needed to be done. 
	\item Test manager- Jens Even Berg Blomsøy
The test manager has been responsible for writings tests and making sure the test would be completed. Testing of the more finished product with both customer and independent people has been important. Testing in these last stages has been needed to tweak and change small functions and views. To get confirmation that the product was up to the thought functionality and quality has bean great, and the test manager has been a great help enforcing this.
	\item Database manager - Jens Even Berg Blomsøy
Having one fully responsible for the database has been much needed, when the features within the game went from being hard coded to dynamic, the database manager was the one supervising this transition. 
	\item Documentation manager - Sindre Svendsrud
The documentation manager has been the one finding out what needed to be written within the report, and has been of great use. Making TODO lists and making things easier to work with. The documentations manager has also been the one to find faults and making sure the whole report has been proofread.
\end{itemize}


\section{Process model}
Our process model the modified waterfall model has worked fine. We have had some  deviations to the model though. New requirements was proposed by the customer later in the project when we had already started the design. So the process model has not been followed completely, this however has not been a problem. The design  and implementation part has worked very well for us, since we have had good contact and regular meetings with the customer. If some features were unsatisfying, the design process could start over again. Even though this was possible only small changes has had to be made. The customer has for the very most part been satisfied with the new features showed each time. Having the verification part at the end of our process has suited us great. Being able to push forward to completion, without every part having to be thoroughly tested before a next feature could be introduced, has been good for the development and progress of the game. 
\subsection{Project Planning}
Our project planning has been based on the requirements, getting the core up and running first and from there, building everything around it. This has worked well four our part, since the team only consists of 6 people. If the case had been else vise, being a larger team, we would have had to plan the project even better. What needed to be done when was early documented, as shown in our Gannt diagram. For the report part the frames had already been set so this was an easier task to plan. There has always been something to do for everyone at any point, knowing this one was only to ask the team manager what should be done next.


\section{Development language}
Our development language Javascript has been a great language to work with. And a great language to learn for the members of the group who had no previously experience with it. The language has worked great for the reason we described for choosing it. We have had some problems with Javascript 

How was javascript to work with?

UPDATE

Early in the project there were daily meetings. Later on the need for daily meetings was regarded as unnecessary as the team was able to work individually with the appointed tasks. Therefore, the number of meetings was reduced to three days a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays). On Tuesdays and Thursdays the team members worked at home. Mondays were used as a sort of “kick-off”-day for the week and were used to plan specific tasks that were to be done during the week. This increased the efficiency.\\
\\
During week 9 the group member responsible for sending status reports to the customer and supervisor was on vacation. Because of that, no status report was sent that week. The lesson learned from this is that communication within the team is crucial for the completion of all tasks in time.\\
\\
In the start of the project, there were little communication within the group. No standards were set
for coding purposes and later on when the database names did not match the names in the program, there were some unnescessary problems. This was solved by setting code standards and better communication between the different 
parts of the team. \\
